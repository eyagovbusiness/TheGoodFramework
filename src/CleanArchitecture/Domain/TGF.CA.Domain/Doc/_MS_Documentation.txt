Best practices working with Aggregates: 
-References: Reference other aggregates by identity, not by holding direct references to other aggregates.
-Transactions: Transactions should not span multiple aggregates to maintain consistency without excessive locking.
-Size of Aggregates: Keep aggregates as small as possible. Large aggregates can lead to complex transactions and performance issues.
